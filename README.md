this code is implemented to create a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history.
here i have used following libraries and packages for creating k-means clustering algorithm:
  - pandas for dataframe
  - numpy for numerical opertaions
  - matplotlib for visulaization
  - seaborn for visulaization with more built in theme
  - plotly for creating an interactive and dynamic visualization
  - sklearn for data analysis and prediction
  - metrics :
     -silhouette_score : used to measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. It ranges from -1 to 1, where a higher value indicates better-defined clusters.
     -davies_bouldin_score : used to measure the ratio of within-cluster distances to between-cluster distances. Lower values indicate better clustering.
     -calinski_harabasz_score : used to measure the ratio of the sum of between-cluster dispersion to the within-cluster dispersion. Higher values indicate better clustering.
